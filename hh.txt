This is a version branch problem. At this time, we only need to create a new branch, switch branches twice, and delete the newly created branch to solve it!

The command line is as follows:

1. Create a new branch:

$ git branch newbranch 
2. Check whether the branch is successfully created:

$ git branch
3. Switch to the new branch:

$ git checkout newbranch
4. Add and submit the code to the new branch:

$ git add . 
$ git commit -m new branch
5. Git status check is successful:

$ git status
6. Switch to the main branch:

$ git checkout master 
7. Merge the code submitted by the new branch to the main branch:

$ git merge newbranch 
8. Push code:

$ git push origin master
9. You can delete the branch according to your own situation:

$ git branch -D newbranch
